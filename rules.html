        <h2>RULES OF PLAY & POLICIES</h2>
        <span>IHF rules shall govern MDHL play except as modified herein.</span>

    <div>
        <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
            <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals <br>
                of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee <br>
                whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey<br> 
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>
    
        <h2>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
            <p>
               <strong>1. DIMENSIONS.</strong> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a <br>
               given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by <br>
               teams under 12 and older.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>2. COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program must be <br>
                a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in <br>
                the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these <br>
                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields <br>
                Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum <br>
                dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to <br>
                provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>3. FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong>
                <br>a. U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields <br>
                 for older age groups should be progressively larger.
                <br>b. U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.
                <br>c. U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.
                <br>d. In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal <br>
                 dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.
            </p>
    
        <h2>ALL-PLAY</h2>
            <p>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play at least fifty percent of each game. 
                <br> Coaches in the competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Â°</strong>A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and injuries.
